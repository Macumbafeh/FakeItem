1.3 (4/3/18):
	* Separated the big data table into a load on-demand addon.

1.2 (1/6/16):
   * Added Vanilla-style suffixes.
   * Querying the server for an unknown ID is now fully automated instead of saying to try again in a few seconds.
   * Minor GUI changes to not look as ugly, to explain the power input and checkboxes, and to break up a few huge enchantment submenus.

1.1 (10/20/15):
   * Item icons can now be dropped onto the window to start editing them.
   * Added checkboxes to make the text color red for the enchantment and 4th gem slot (not possible for the others).
   * Added "Equipment > Boots/Bracer/Chest/etc" submenus with named enchantments to make it easier to find real things that might be used.
   * Replaced Gems submenus with organized ones using proper names and probably the correct enchant IDs.
   * Items should now show any pre-existing enchantment and gem names instead of just "default" for each field.
